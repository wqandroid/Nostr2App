# NostrPostr - A nostr client and library for Android


# Overview

This repository consists of multiple modules that will eventually be split into their own
repositories but as long as the basic libraries and tools are in very active development, juggling
multiple repositories isn't worth it yet.

## Nostr Library in Kotlin - nostrpostrlib

This is the core all other modules build upon. It provides facilities to connect to nostr relays,
to send and receive events, to encrypt/decrypt messages, ...

## Examples

Here you can find some simple use cases of the library.

## Android App

Here are the first efforts of developing a full Nostr Social client for Android.

It's basically abandoned in favor of [Nostroid](https://github.com/Giszmo/nostroid) and absent
others putting work into it, it will be removed from this repo.

## NostrRelay

This is a full relay implementation.

# History

As of the date of creation of this repository there was no Android nostr client. There was no nostr
library for Android neither. The goal is to provide both with a focus on a clean and generally
usable, fully featured library and a client with basic functionality.

# FAQ

  censorship-resistant global social network once and for all". Read more about it
